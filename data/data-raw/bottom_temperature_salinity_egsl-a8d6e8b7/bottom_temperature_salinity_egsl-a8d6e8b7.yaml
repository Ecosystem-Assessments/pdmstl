  description: Gridded temperature and salinity of the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence
    bottom waters including shallow waters. Data are a result of a 3D interpolation
    on a 1km x 1km x bottom depth grid. They mostly come from the 2 multidisciplinary
    surveys but all the available CTD data sampled in August and September were used.
