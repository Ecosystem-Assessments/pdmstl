  abstract = {Aim Distribution modelling relates sparse data on species occurrence or abundance to environmental information to predict the population of a species at any point in space. Recently, the importance of spatial autocorrelation in distributions has been recognized. Spatial autocorrelation can be categorized as exogenous (stemming from autocorrelation in the underlying variables) or endogenous (stemming from activities of the organism itself, such as dispersal). Typically, one asks whether spatial models explain additional variability (endogenous) in comparison to a fully specified habitat model. We turned this question around and asked: can habitat models explain additional variation when spatial structure is accounted for in a fully specified spatially explicit model? The aim was to find out to what degree habitat models may be inadvertently capturing spatial structure rather than true explanatory mechanisms. Location We used data from 190 species of the North American Breeding Bird Survey covering the conterminous United States and southern Canada. Methods We built 13 different models on 190 bird species using regression trees. Our habitat-based models used climate and landcover variables as independent variables. We also used random variables and simulated ranges to validate our results. The two spatially explicit models included only geographical coordinates or a contagion term as independent variables. As another angle on the question of mechanism vs. spatial structure we pitted a model using related bird species as predictors against a model using randomly selected bird species. Results The spatially explicit models outperformed the traditional habitat models and the random predictor species outperformed the related predictor species. In addition, environmental variables produced a substantial R2 in predicting artificial ranges. Main conclusions We conclude that many explanatory variables with suitable spatial structure can work well in species distribution models. The predictive power of environmental variables is not necessarily mechanistic, and spatial interpolation can outperform environmental explanatory variables.},

  abstract = {Deep-sea corals are fragile and long-lived species that provide important habitat for a variety of taxa. The rarity of in situ observations in deep waters off Newfoundland, Canada, motivated the first extensive deep-sea research cruise to that region in 2007. We conducted 7 dives in 3 canyons (Haddock Channel, Halibut Channel, and Desbarres Canyon) with ROPOS (Remotely Operated Platform for Ocean Science). Over 160000 coral colonies were enumerated and, of the 28 species found, Acanella arbuscula, Pennatula spp., and Flabellum spp. were most frequently observed. The largest coral observed was Keratoisis grayi at over 2 m in height. Corals spanned the entire depth range sampled (351 to 2245 m) and inhabited all bottom types surveyed, but boulder and cobble habitats were most species-rich. Assemblages differed significantly with depth class and bottom type. The unique assemblage at outcrops was strongly driven by the presence of Desmophyllum dianthus. Keratoisis grayi, D. dianthus, and Anthomastus spp. were largely absent in mud-sand habitats. Sea pen meadows covered large tracts of muddy seafloor spanning {$>$}1 km. Acanella arbuscula and Flabellum spp. characterised large coral fields with abundant corals but relatively low species richness. These results highlight not only the importance of hard structure in determining patterns of coral distributions, abundances, and assemblages, but also the need to focus conservation efforts on a variety of habitats to ensure protection for the full suite of deep-sea coral species.},

  abstract = {Sea pen communities are United Nations General Assembly-designated Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems which occur worldwide in soft-bottom sediments where trawling often occurs. However, the ability of marine managers to assess, monitor and mitigate impacts to sea pens at national scales has been constrained by a limited understanding of their environmental requirements, geographical distribution and responses to trawling. In this study, we used random forest species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict the distribution of suitable habitat for 3 sea pen species (tall sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis, slender sea pen Virgularia mirabilis and phosphorescent sea pen Pennatula phosphorea) on the UK continental shelf, exploring the results relative to the distribution of fishing activity. Occurrence of all 3 species corresponded to areas of low current and wave velocity, where suspended matter in the water column was also low. However, for F. quadrangularis, the largest species, the models indicated substantially different drivers of distribution between the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas ICES Ecoregions. This disparity appears to reflect modification to the range and realised niche of this species in the Greater North Sea, due to trawling impacts. P. phosphorea and V. mirabilis appear to be more resilient to trawling, with no clear negative relationships observed. Our findings illustrate the value of broadscale qualitative comparisons between SDMs and human activity data for insights on pressure-state relationships. When combined with robust distribution maps, this improved understanding of vulnerability will enable marine managers to make ecologically sound, defensible decisions and deliver tangible conservation outcomes for sea pen communities.},

The sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis and the habitat associated with two further sea pen species, Virgularia mirabilis and Pennatula phosphorea, are of key conservation importance and are recommended for protection within MPAs. This study models their potential distributions using the MAXimum ENTropy algorithm and assesses these in relation to five possible marine protected areas (pMPAs) proposed for Scottish waters. Metrics relevant to assessing the efficacy of MPAs are also presented. Four environmental variables of prime importance for predicting the presence of all three species of sea pen were identified: mud, minimum salinity, depth, and gravel. The habitat suitability index increased with mud content. The modelled distribution of F. quadrangularis indicated a deeper distribution than V. mirabilis or P. phosphorea and was not present in sediment with gravel content above 30\%. Pennatula phosphorea had the smallest area of suitable habitat, while V. mirabilis had the largest. The percentage predicted suitable area for each species that was encompassed by the five pMPAs ranged from 11\% for F. quadrangularis to 15\% for P. phosphorea. Some of the largest areas predicted as suitable for F. quadrangularis lay outside the pMPAs. The model results indicated differences in the environmental requirements of the three species of sea pen that can be linked to the autecology of each species. Patch sizes, calculated from a binary output of the model, were used to estimate the degree of habitat fragmentation, thereby giving a partial assessment of the adequacy criterion for these pMPAs. The results suggest that potential MPAs within the study area cover sizeable areas of potential sea pen habitat. However, further areas suitable for F. quadrangularis could be considered.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology and related fields. They are frequently adopted to predict the expected occurrence (presence/absence) or abundance over large spatial scales, that is, to produce a species distribution map. Two issues that almost universally affect these models are measurement errors (especially imperfect detection) and residual spatial autocorrelation. We explored the effects of imperfect detection and autocorrelation in abundance models by simulating datasets which did or did not contain these two effects and analysing them with four different models that did or did not accommodate them. Specifically, we used a Poisson GLM as a baseline, an N-mixture model accounting only for imperfect detection and two N-mixture models that accounted for imperfect detection, but differed in their specification of spatial autocorrelation (CAR random effects vs. two-dimensional splines). In a case study, we then applied these models to Common Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus data from the second Swiss Breeding Bird Atlas (1993\textendash 1996) and validated them using an independent monitoring dataset. We found that both imperfect detection and autocorrelation strongly affected the quality and the uncertainty of abundance maps, especially when they occurred together. Spatial N-mixture models were well able to estimate the true abundance maps. Explicit modelling of measurement error and spatial autocorrelation can thus greatly improve the quality of SDMs and should not be ignored when producing large-scale abundance or occurrence maps.},

  abstract = {Information on the distribution of cold-water corals in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) waters largely comes from scientific multi-species trawl surveys and commercial fisheries observer programs. As a result, knowledge of coral distribution has been influenced by the type of gear used and by fishing effort distribution, leaving large knowledge gaps beyond the fishing footprint along the edge of the continental shelf. In support of international efforts to preserve marine biodiversity, maximum entropy (Maxent) species distribution models (SDMs) were generated for cold-water coral functional groups and individual species to predict their distributions throughout the NL region. Although functional group models have also been produced using a random forest (RF) approach in the past, the species level models provided here are thought to be the first of their kind in the NL region. Models generated for this study were found to be statistically robust, even for species with limited observation data, with average area under the receiver operating curve and true skill statistic values of 0.914 and 0.684, respectively. Findings indicated that models for functional groups typically overgeneralized habitat suitability and did not always reflect the distribution of the individual species they were based on. Furthermore, suitable habitats delineated by Maxent fit more closely to in situ observations than existing models generated for this region, providing more realistic estimates of habitat suitability at bathyal and abyssal depths. In general, the highest suitability was found along the continental shelf break and within canyons on the upper continental shelf, with Maxent models capturing variations in habitat suitability not previously described in the region.},

  abstract = {Summary. Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat\'ern class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

  abstract = {Most high-performing species distribution modelling techniques require both presences, and either absences or pseudo-absences or background points. In this paper, we explore the effect of sample size, towards developing improved strategies for modelling. We generated 1800 virtual species with three levels of prevalence using ten modelling techniques, while varying the number of training presences (NTP) and the number of random points (NRP representing pseudo-absences or background sites). For five of the ten modelling techniques we built two versions of models: one with an equal total weight (ETW) setting where the total weight for pseudo-absence is equivalent to the total weight for presence, and another with an unequal total weight (UTW) setting where the total weight for pseudo-absence is not required to be equal to the total weight for presence. We compared two strategies for NRP: a small multiplier strategy (i.e. setting NRP at a few times as large as NTP), and a large number strategy (i.e. using numerous random points). We produced ensemble models (by averaging the predictions from 30 models built with the same set of training presences and different sets of random points in equivalent numbers) for three NTP magnitudes and two NRP strategies. We found that model accuracy altered as NRP increased with four distinct patterns of performance: increasing, decreasing, arch-shaped and horizontal. In most cases ETW improved model performance. Ensemble models had higher accuracy than the corresponding single models, and this improvement was pronounced when NTP was low. We conclude that a large NRP is not always an appropriate strategy. The best choice for NRP will depend on the modelling techniques used, species prevalence and NTP. We recommend building ensemble models instead of single models, using the small multiplier strategy for NRP with ETW, especially when only a small number of species presence records are available.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth. Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 \% were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 \%). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 \%) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 \%). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 \%) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMs (22 \%) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 \%). The groups most studied were fish (23 \%), molluscs (16 \%), and marine mammals (14 \%), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species.},

Distribution of deep-water corals of the Flemish Cap, Flemish Pass, and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland (Northwest Atlantic Ocean): interaction with fishing activities. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 319\textendash 332.The distribution of deep-water corals of the Flemish Cap, Flemish Pass, and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland is described based on bycatch from Spanish/EU bottom trawl groundfish surveys between 40 and 1500 m depth. In all, 37 taxa of deep-water corals were identified in the study area: 21 alcyonaceans (including the gorgonians), 11 pennatulaceans, 2 solitary scleractinians, and 3 antipatharians. The greatest diversity of coral species was on the Flemish Cap. Corals were most abundant along the continental slope, between 600 and 1300 m depth. Soft corals (alcyonaceans), sea fans (gorgonians), and black corals (antipatharians) were most common on bedrock or gravel, whereas sea pens (pennatulaceans) and cup corals (solitary scleractinians) were found primarily on mud. The biomass of deep-water corals in the bycatches was highest in previously lightly trawled or untrawled areas, and generally low in the regularly fished grounds. The information derived from bottom-trawl bycatch records is not sufficient to map vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) accurately, but pending more detailed habitat mapping, it provides a valuable indication of the presence/absence of VMEs that can be used to propose the candidate areas for bottom fishery closures or other conservation measures.},

  abstract = {Growth rates and longevity are key factors in assessing the vulnerability of many invertebrates to anthropogenic disturbance. Sea pens are benthic invertebrates frequently entrained as fisheries bycatch, but whose growth (recovery) rates are poorly known. Here, longevity and growth rates were estimated for the deep-water sea pen Halipteris finmarchica from the Northwest Atlantic and compared to those published for Halipteris willemoesi from the Bering Sea. Axes were cross sectioned to visualise growth rings and estimate longevity and growth rates. Chronology of growth rings was examined with trace element microanalysis of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, Ba/Ca and Na/Ca in the axis using Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry. The relationship between growth rates and environmental variables was investigated. The number of rings ranged from 13 to 22 among 26 colonies. Trace element microanalysis yielded a number of elemental ratio peaks comparable to the number of rings visually determined. Diametric growth rates were significantly smaller than those published for H. willemoesi, while linear growth rates (extension in height) were not different. No significant relationships were detected between growth rates and environmental variables for H. finmarchica. Our data suggest that H. finmarchica is a slow-growing, relatively long-lived organism whose recovery from damage can take over 20~years.},

  abstract = {The suite of factors that drives where and under what conditions a species occurs has become the focus of intense research interest. Three general categories of methods have emerged by which researchers address questions in this area: mechanistic models of species' requirements in terms of environmental conditions that are based on first principles of biophysics and physiology, correlational models based on environmental associations derived from analyses of geographic occurrences of species, and process-based simulations that estimate occupied distributional areas and associated environments from assumptions about niche dimensions and dispersal abilities. We review strengths and weaknesses of these sets of approaches, and identify significant advantages and disadvantages of each. Rather than identifying one or the other as `better,' we suggest that researchers take great care to use the method best-suited to each specific research question, and be conscious of the weaknesses of any method, such that inappropriate interpretations are avoided.},

  abstract = {Sea pens are considered to be of conservation relevance according to multiple international legislations and agreements. Consequently, any information about their ecology and distribution should be of use to management decision makers. This study aims to provide such information about six taxa of sea pen in Norwegian waters [Funiculina quadrangularis (Pallas, 1766), Halipteris spp., Kophobelemnon stelliferum (M\"uller, 1776), Pennatulidae spp., Umbellula spp., and Virgulariidae spp.]. Data exploration techniques and ensembled species distribution modelling (SDM) are applied to video observations obtained by the MAREANO project between 2006 and 2020. Norway-based ecological profiles and predicted distributions are provided and discussed. External validations and uncertainty metrics highlight model weaknesses (overfitting, limited training/external observations) and consistencies relevant to marine management. Comparison to international literature further identifies globally relevant findings: (a) disparities in the environmental profile of F. quadrangularis suggest differing ``realised niches'' in different locations, potentially highlighting this taxon as particularly vulnerable to impact, (b) none of the six sea pen taxa were found to consistently co-occur, instead partially overlapping environmental profiles suggests that grouping taxa as ``sea pens and burrowing megafauna'' should be done with caution post-analyses only, (c) higher taxonomic level groupings, while sometimes necessary due to identification issues, result in poorer quality predictive models and may mask the occurrence of rarer species. Community-based groupings are therefore preferable due to confirmed shared ecological niches while greater value should be placed on accurate species ID to support management efforts.},

  abstract = {Summary. Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {Two-part joint models for a longitudinal semicontinuous biomarker and a terminal event have been recently introduced based on frequentist estimation. The biomarker distribution is decomposed into a probability of positive value and the expected value among positive values. Shared random effects can represent the association structure between the biomarker and the terminal event. The computational burden increases compared to standard joint models with a single regression model for the biomarker. In this context, the frequentist estimation implemented in the R package frailtypack can be challenging for complex models (i.e., a large number of parameters and dimension of the random effects). As an alternative, we propose a Bayesian estimation of two-part joint models based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) algorithm to alleviate the computational burden and fit more complex models. Our simulation studies confirm that INLA provides accurate approximation of posterior estimates and to reduced computation time and variability of estimates compared to frailtypack in the situations considered. We contrast the Bayesian and frequentist approaches in the analysis of two randomized cancer clinical trials (GERCOR and PRIME studies), where INLA has a reduced variability for the association between the biomarker and the risk of event. Moreover, the Bayesian approach was able to characterize subgroups of patients associated with different responses to treatment in the PRIME study. Our study suggests that the Bayesian approach using the INLA algorithm enables to fit complex joint models that might be of interest in a wide range of clinical applications.},

Thirteen alcyonaceans, two antipatharians, four solitary scleractinians, and 11 pennatulaceans were recorded. Corals were broadly distributed along the continental shelf edge and slope, with most species found deeper than 200 m; only nephtheid soft corals were found on the shelf. Large branching corals with robust skeletons included Paragorgia arborea (Linnaeus, 1758), Primnoa resedaeformis (Gunnerus, 1763), Keratoisis ornata (Verrill, 1878), Acanthogorgia armata (Verrill, 1878), Paramuricea spp., and two antipatharians. Coral distributions were highly clustered, with most co-occurring with other species. Scientific survey data delineated two broad coral species richness hotspots: southwest Grand Bank (16 spp.) and an area of the Labrador slope between Makkovik Bank and Belle Isle Bank (14 spp.). Fisheries observations indicated abundant or diverse corals off southeast Baffin Island, Cape Chidley, Labrador, Tobin's Point, and the Flemish Cap. Corals on the Flemish Cap comprised exclusively soft coral, sea pens, and solitary scleractinians. Most coral-rich areas were suggested in earlier research based on stock assessment surveys or Local Environmental Knowledge (LEK). Currently there are no conservation measures in place to protect deep-sea coral in this region.},

  abstract = {Aim Three-quarters of Octocorallia species are found in deep waters. These cold-water octocoral colonies can form a major constituent of structurally complex habitats. The global distribution and the habitat requirements of deep-sea octocorals are poorly understood given the expense and difficulties of sampling at depth. Habitat suitability models are useful tools to extrapolate distributions and provide an understanding of ecological requirements. Here, we present global habitat suitability models and distribution maps for seven suborders of Octocorallia: Alcyoniina, Calcaxonia, Holaxonia, Scleraxonia, Sessiliflorae, Stolonifera and Subselliflorae. Location Global. Methods We use maximum entropy modelling to predict octocoral distribution using a database of 12,508 geolocated octocoral specimens and 32 environmental grids resampled to 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km2) resolution. Additionally, a meta-analysis determined habitat preferences and niche overlap between the different suborders of octocorals. Results Suborder Sessiliflorae had the widest potential habitat range, but all records for all suborders implied a habitat preference for continental shelves and margins, particularly the North and West Atlantic and Western Pacific Rim. Temperature, salinity, broad scale slope, productivity, oxygen and calcite saturation state were identified as important factors for determining habitat suitability. Less than 3\% of octocoral records were found in waters undersaturated for calcite, but this result is affected by a shallow-water sampling bias. Main conclusions The logistical difficulties, expense and vast areas associated with deep-sea sampling leads to a gap in the knowledge of faunal distributions that is difficult to fill without predictive modelling. Global distribution estimates are presented, highlighting many suitable areas which have yet to be studied. We suggest that approximately 17\% of oceans are suitable for at least one suborder but 3.5\% may be suitable for all seven. This is the first global habitat suitability modelling study on the distribution of octocorals and forms a useful resource for researchers, managers and conservationists.},
